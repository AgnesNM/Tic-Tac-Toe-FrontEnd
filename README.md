# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is my first ever Python frontend project. I have used tkinter as a GUI. Download [![executable files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NhpiGLU6WbVXE3QGhrr2TicfhP22tXTt?usp=sharing)]

## Technologies
The technologies used this far:
* Python 3.6.9 (64-bit) - using Python 3.7+ is ideal as tkinter is already installed
* Tk/Tcl 8.6
* Git
* GitHub

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Linux OS
* Text Editor (Atom, Visual Studio Code)
* Linux Terminal
* At least Python 3.7+ (for Python 3.6 and below, you needto install [![Tk/Tcl 8.5+](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)] - ensure that you have chosen Python as the language of interest on the right tab 
* The tkinter module
* PyInstaller (to convert the app to an executable file that you can download and use on [![Windows](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NhpiGLU6WbVXE3QGhrr2TicfhP22tXTt?usp=sharing). For [[!Linux] (https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)] users you need to install [[!Wine] (https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)] or use [![PlayOnLinux] (https://youtu.be/EqKIRGTAUB8)]
