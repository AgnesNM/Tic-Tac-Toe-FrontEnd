# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is my first ever Python frontend project. I have used tkinter as a GUI. Download executable files here: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NhpiGLU6WbVXE3QGhrr2TicfhP22tXTt?usp=sharing). You will find it in the Dist folder.

## Technologies
The technologies used this far:
* Python 3.6.9 (64-bit) - using Python 3.7+ is ideal as tkinter is already installed
* Tk/Tcl 8.6
* Git
* GitHub

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Linux OS
* Text Editor (Atom, Visual Studio Code)
* Linux Terminal
* At least Python 3.7+ (for Python 3.6 and below, you needto install Tk/Tcl 8.5+: (https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) - ensure that you have chosen Python as the language of interest on the right tab 
* The tkinter module
* PyInstaller (to convert the app to an executable file that you can download and use on Windows: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NhpiGLU6WbVXE3QGhrr2TicfhP22tXTt?usp=sharing). For Linux: Install Wine: (https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) or use PlayOnLinux: check tutorial here:(https://youtu.be/EqKIRGTAUB8)

If you would like to contribute to this project, the following BDD specs should help you:smile:

Behavior                                           |  Input Example    | Output Example
---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------
Assign x or o on user click                        | [x]                                      | [x]
Allow the user to see whether they have won        | [x,x,x]                                  | [Player x wins]
Allow the user to see whether it's a draw          | 9 entries with noconsecyutive x's or o's | [It's a draw]
